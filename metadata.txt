about=This plugin is a simple tool for downloading parts of popular web map services. 
    WARNING: Works only with Python's Pillow module which has to be installed in QGIS
    
    A brief instruction. 
    1. Select a web map source you want to clip 
    2. Set zoom level (the more value - the longer download process will be) 
    3. Draw a frame on map like a rectangle 
    4. Set folder to save your image 
    5. Press download. 

    In result you will see a georeferenced image cropped to frame. Additionaly you can unset "Add image on load" if you don't want images to be automatically added to current project. You can also save your frames to *.xtnt files and then load them in after closing the widget
